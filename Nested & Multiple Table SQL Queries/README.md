# Nested & Multiple Table SQL Queries
This was the 2<sup>nd</sup> SQL project that I completed and it involved writing complex nested and multiple table queries to extract relevant data from multiple text files containing information.

A short description/question is included with each SQL query to state what information the query extracts.

This project was completed within Repl.it!
