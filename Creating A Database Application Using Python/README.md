# Creating A Database Application Using Python
This was the 3<sup>rd</sup> SQL project that I completed and it involved using a combination of Python and SQL to create a fully functional database application for storing information about employees in a workplace, e.g. the University of Bath.

The database is created when the program is first run and it is stored as a .db file.

The database application has a range of functionality, each of which can be chosen through a command line input:
1. Create table EmployeeUoB - Creates table within .db file to store the employee data
2. Insert data into EmployeeUoB - Allows information for an employee to be entered into database
3. Select all data into EmployeeUoB - Outputs all information for all employees
4. Search an employee - Outputs all information for selected employee
5. Update data some records - Allows information for an existing employee to be changed
6. Delete data some records - Deletes selected employee from database
7. Delete table EmployeeUoB - Deletes entire database (.db file will NOT be deleted)

This project was completed within Repl.it!
